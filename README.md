## What is a Chrome Extension?
A chrome extension is a program that is installed in the Chrome browser that enhances the functionality of the browser. You can build one easily using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to install to your browser

1. Go to `Select More Tools` and then choose `Extensions` from the browser menu as shown in the picture below:
2. After choosing Extensions, it redirects to the extensions page in Chrome. Make sure to enable the `Developer mode` here.
3. Once that's done, you need to click the `Load unpacked` button which will allow us to load our project in the Chrome extension store.
4. Now, the extension is available in our Chrome extension store.
